# RL_FOR_CARTPOLE
This code make use on keras-rl2 to implement reinforecement learning on the 'cartpole' environment of 'gym'. The png file shows the training results for different netword sizes.

Notes:
1. package compatibility issues can be avaoided by running the notebook on colab
2. the altenative approach is still work in progress. It is an attempt to reporduce the same results at keras-rl with using keras-rl.
